# Contributing
We generally create issues in GitHub before contributing code. This helps front-load the conversation before the code. By creating an issue first, it creates an opportunity to bounce our ideas off each other to see what's feasible and what ways to approach the issue.

By contrast, starting with a pull request makes it more difficult to revisit the approach. Many PRs are treated as mostly done and shouldn't need much work to get merged. Nobody wants to receive PR feedback that says "start over" or "closing: won't merge." That's discouraging to everyone, and we can avoid those situations if we have the discussion together earlier in the development process. It might be a mental switch for you to start the discussion earlier, but it makes us all more productive and and our rules more effective.
